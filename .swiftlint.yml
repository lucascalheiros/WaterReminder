# By default, SwiftLint uses a set of sensible default rules you can adjust:
disabled_rules: # rule identifiers turned on by default to exclude from running
  - colon
  - comma
  - control_statement
  - trailing_whitespace
  - line_length
opt_in_rules: # some rules are turned off by default, so you need to opt-in
  - empty_count # Find all the available rules by running: `swiftlint rules`

# Alternatively, specify all rules explicitly by uncommenting this option:
# only_rules: # delete `disabled_rules` & `opt_in_rules` if using this
#   - empty_parameters
#   - vertical_whitespace

analyzer_rules: # Rules run by `swiftlint analyze`
  - explicit_self

included: # paths to include during linting. `--path` is ignored if present.
  - WaterReminder
excluded: # paths to ignore during linting. Takes precedence over `included`.
  - Pods
  - WaterReminder/ExcludedFolder
  - WaterReminder/ExcludedFile.swift
  - WaterReminder/*/ExcludedFile.swift # Exclude files with a wildcard
